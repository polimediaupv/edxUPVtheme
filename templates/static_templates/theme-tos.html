  <h1 id="tos" style="text-align: left;">Welcome to the Stanford Online Learning and Research Community</h1>

  <p>Stanford University pursues the science of learning. Online learners are important participants in that pursuit. The information we gather from people’s engagement with our instructional offerings makes it possible for faculty, researchers, designers and engineers to continuously improve their work and, in that process, build learning science.</p>

  <p>By registering as an online learner, you are also participating in research intended to enhance Stanford’s instructional offerings as well as the quality of learning and related sciences worldwide. In the interest of research, you may be exposed to some variations in the course materials. Stanford does not use learner data for any purpose beyond the University’s stated missions of education and research. For purposes of research, we may share information we collect from online learning activities, including Personally Identifiable Information, with researchers beyond Stanford. However, your Personally Identifiable Information will only be shared as permitted by applicable law, will be limited to what is necessary to perform the research, and will be subject to an agreement to protect the data. We may also share with the public or third parties aggregated information that does not personally identify you. Similarly, any research findings will be reported at the aggregate level and will not expose your personal identity.</p>

  <p>Please read our Privacy Policy for more information regarding the processing, transmission and use of data collected through the Stanford Online website and Stanford’s OpenEdX platform.</p>

  <p><strong>How We Use and Share the Information</strong></p>

  <p>Please take some time to familiarize yourself with the different ways Stanford uses and may disclose the information that we gather. We do not share your Personally Identifiable Information with third parties for their direct marketing use.</p>

  <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Non-Personal Information</span>. Stanford uses Non-Personal Information in aggregate form to build higher quality, more useful services by performing statistical analyses of the collective characteristics and behavior of our users, and by measuring demographics and interests regarding specific areas of our Site. Such aggregate information may include but is not limited to video player interactions, views of posts, views and actions on pages, assessment results and completion rates and assignments. We may share Non-Personal Information with service providers and others to assist us in operating and enhancing our programs and site.</p>

  <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Personally Identifiable Information</span>. Among other things, Stanford may use the Personally Identifiable Information that you provide to respond to your questions, provide you the specific course and/or services you select, send you updates about online courses offered by Stanford or other Stanford events, and send you email messages about Site maintenance or updates. Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy or as specifically agreed to by you, Stanford will not disclose any Personally Identifiable Information we gather from you on the Site. In addition to the other uses set forth in this Privacy Policy, Stanford may disclose and otherwise use Personally Identifiable Information as described below.</p>

  <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Updates</span>.

In addition Stanford may display this information either on the Site and/or in other publications.

Since the forum is open to the public, you may wish to select a username which does not disclose your identity when you post on the forum.</p>

  <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Participation in Online Courses</span>. We use the Personally Identifiable Information, including but not limited to username and email address, that we collect from you when you participate in an online course through the Site for processing purposes, including but not limited to tracking attendance, progress and completion of an online course.

Such records may include but will not be limited to: username, email address, home address, postal code, gender, year of birth, forum posts and your interactions with the platform such as video player usage, forum posts, actions on class pages, assignments, and assessment results.

However, your PII will only be shared as permitted by applicable law, will be limited to what is necessary to perform the research and will be subject to an agreement to protect the data. We may also share with the public or third parties aggregated information that does not personally identify you. Similarly, any research findings will be reported at the aggregate level and will not expose your personal identity.</p>
